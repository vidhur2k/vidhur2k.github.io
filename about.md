Hi! My name is Vidhur Kumar and I am currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech with a specialization in Computing Systems. Currently, I work with <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jabernethy9/" target="_blank">Jacob Abernathy</a> as part of the GT Undergrad ML Theory Research team. Our research focuses on understanding theoretical guarantees for various optimization problems in Machine Learning such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and robustness to adversarial examples. Check out our <a href="https://umltheorygt.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">website</a> if you're interested!

<br />

If those bore you, my other interests include Cricket, Soccer, Basketball, Poker, and Powerlifting. I can take all day about this stuff, so feel free to shoot me an email at vidhur2k@gmail.com if you'd like to chat!
