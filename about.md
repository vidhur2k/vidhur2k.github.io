Hi!

My name is Vidhur Kumar and I am currently an undergraduate student at Georgia Tech studying Computer Science. My specializations are in Artificial Intelligence and Theoretical Computer Science. Currently, I work with <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jabernethy9/" target="_blank">Jacob Abernathy</a> as part of the GT Undergrad ML Theory Research team. Our research focuses on understanding theoretical guarantees for various optimization problems in Machine Learning such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and robustness to adversarial examples. Check out our <a href="https://umltheorygt.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">website</a> if you're interested!

I also serve as Director of Technology and a senior content creator for <a href="https://datasciencegt.org" target="_blank">Data Science at Georgia Tech</a>, a student-run organization that serves over 200 students on campus. My responsibilities include leading the development and management of the portal for the club and <a href="https://hacklytics.io" target="_blank">Hacklytics</a>, our annual datathon. I also regularly run workshops where we teach members various topics related to Data Science such as preprocessing techniques, discriminative and generative modeling, neural network architectures, etc.

If those bore you, my other interests include Cricket, Soccer, Basketball, Poker, and Powerlifting. I can take all day about this stuff, so feel free to shoot me an email at vidhur2k@gmail.com if you'd like to chat!
