<h2 id="background-and-motivations">Background and Motivations</h2>

<p>Released in 1978, Space Invaders is one of the earliest shooting games to enter the arcade and handheld game arena. Drawing inspiration from 
<em>Breakout</em> and <em>Gunfight</em>, the game was built with a simple objective: to defeat waves of aliens with a laser and earn as many points as
possible.</p>

<p>The day I discovered this game still occupies a special place in my memories. Dad brought home a blue box that read SPACE INVADER with a rectangular
black box below it. Both of these had me confused (cut me some slack, I was five). I turned it on to see the same sequence of letters appear, asking me to hit one of the yellow buttons on the bottom of the device. It took me to a screen with a bunch of numbers and dots, some bigger than the others.</p>

<p>And that was that. I don’t remember understanding why the dots were differently sized or why the numbers changed by different amounts. I just played and played. Not once did I care to try and figure out what I was shooting (It was only in 6th grade that someone explained what the actual objective of the game was.) When it comes to gaming, my primary goal is to have fun. Spending time on the details and the side quests always came after. Just play.</p>

<p>Regretfully, I no longer own the Space Invader handheld device (I only understood what nostalgia meant in my early teens. By then it was too late). This was my motivation to choose this game for my final project, because creating this game brings back the memories of old.</p>

<p>Shown below is a snippet of the GUI for the arcade version.</p>
