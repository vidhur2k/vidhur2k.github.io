    <h2 id="rationale"><strong>Rationale</strong></h2>
<p>I believe that every blogger should have a publicly available reading list. Books offer a way for people to systematically
gain knowledge on specific topics. If said blogger is a known expert in a field, it is likely that they have consumed a lot
of literature related to the field. Publicizing the books they have read would thus help people understand what they have to
do to become experts themselves.</p>

<p>The books I have listed here are primarily non-fiction (I stopped reading fiction a while back). They relate to a variety of topics,
and I believe that each occupies a place of high esteem among other writings of the same topic. Enjoy! :)</p>
