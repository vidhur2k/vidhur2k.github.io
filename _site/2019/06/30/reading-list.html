    <h2 id="rationale"><strong>Rationale</strong></h2>
<p>I believe that every blogger should have a publicly available reading list. Books offer a way for people to systematically
gain knowledge on specific topics. If said blogger is a known expert in a field, it is likely that they have consumed a lot
of literature related to the field. Publicizing the books they have read would thus help people understand what they have to
do to become experts themselves.</p>

<p>The books I have listed here are primarily non-fiction (I stopped reading fiction a while back). They relate to a variety of topics,
and I believe that each occupies a place of high esteem among other writings of the same topic. Enjoy! :)</p>

<h2 id="books"><strong>Books</strong></h2>

<h3 id="zero-to-one-notes-on-startups-or-building-the-future-by-peter-thiel"><strong>Zero to One: Notes on Startups or Building the Future</strong> by Peter Thiel</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is a comprehensive primer for anyone interested in entering or understanding the startup space. Thiel, while controversial in recent times, provides a concrete overview of modern ventures and how they drive us towards building a better future.</li>
  <li>He uses the dot-com bubble both as a marker for the dawn of the Information Age companies and a framework for what to do and not to do while deliberating on whether or not to start a venture.</li>
  <li>Next, he dives into a few important concepts when it comes to ideation, competitor analysis, and financing a startup. Some of these concepts include the last mover advantage, monopoly-driven innovation, and the power law of venture capital.</li>
  <li>The last part of the book explores Thiel’s understanding of what the future will be for two types of ventures: AI and Environmental (“Green”) startups. Overall, I found this to be extremely useful in terms of providing a general framework for the drivers of innovation and any common pitfalls that people face while in the process.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-theory-of-poker-by-david-schlansky"><strong>The Theory of Poker</strong> by David Schlansky</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Too often I found myself clueless in terms of what my move should be in a poker game. It was then I decided that I needed to gain an understanding of the basic mathematics, betting patterns, and psychology of poker. I highly recommend this to anyone who’d like to do the same.</li>
  <li>Schlansky begins by covering the fundamentals of the math behind the game including expected values, odds, and equity. He then takes a ‘semi-digression’ to cover <strong>the fundamental theorem of poker</strong>, which is a simple rule that dictates the profit or loss that one makes while playing poker. He concludes the book with common playing strategies such as semi-bluffs, slowplaying, and check-raising. As a no-limit holdem player, I found his constant switching of games from holdem to Omaha to seven-card stud when he provided examples to be quite annoying. But, in terms of general principles, Schlansky does a fantastic job.</li>
