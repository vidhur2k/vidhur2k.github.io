# Introduction to Machine Learning
Recently, I decided that it was time to formally introduce myself to the field of Machine Learning. While I'm not entirely sure
as to which field I would like to end up in, a lot of people recommended that I gain a solid understanding of the rudiments for 
one very repititive reason: the inevitable event that I encounter it at some point of my career simply because of its
ubiqiuity and its tendency to be widely applicable (sometimes in extremely creative ways).

## So, what is it?
In layman's terms, Machine Learning is "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
to do so". This is a definition that brings excitement to your mind when you think about how cool it would be to make stuff around you smarter.
At the same time, most people also wonder how we would go about tackling such a problem. Historically speaking, computers are imperative, i.e., they do
what you tell them to do. They execute the commands you express in a programming language of your choice without any 'thought'.
